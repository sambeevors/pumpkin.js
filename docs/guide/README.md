# Getting Started

## Installation

You can install with either npm or yarn

```
$ npm i --save pumpkin.js
```

```
$ yarn add pumpkin.js
```

## Usage

You can import the package using ESM imports

```js
import * as $ from 'pumpkin.js'
```

Or just good old CJS imports

```js
const $ = require('pumpkin.js')
```

If you prefer, you can just import specific functions you wish to use

```js
import { qs, ready } from 'pumpkin.js'
```
